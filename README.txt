# Mobile_ml_proj: Predicting mobile prices using a random forest regressor
The purpose of this short project is to get familiar with the basics of machine learning before moving 
on to bigger projects.
## Results:
After experimenting with both a regular decision tree classifier and a random forrest classifier, 
as well as with depths between 2 and 5000 for both i concluded that a standard random classifier
model was the most accurate, with an accuracy of **86%.**

## Data:
